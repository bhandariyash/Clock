# Clock
Implementation of digital and analog clocks using HTML, CSS and JS.

This project contains 4 files which are described below : 

1) clock.html  -  Contains the HTML code.
2) clock.css   -  Contains the CSS code.
3) library.js  -  A self-written library that simulates JQuery $ and defines the functions :
                   a) css(property, value) which can set a single CSS property or multiple CSS properties(passed in an object as key/value                       pairs. In this case object is the only required argument that needs to be passed.). Same way as JQuery css()                               function.
                   b) html(content) which sets the html of the element for which it is called to that passed to the content parameter.
4) clock.js   -  Contains the Javascript code. Uses both the functions defined in the library and timers and some basic Javascript.
